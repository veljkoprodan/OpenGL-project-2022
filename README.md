# OpenGL Project
Mario and ghost have to collect stars from the island, ship, and the hidden room. Mario can jump, change color and go down a pipe to the hidden room, and the ghost can fly.

# Uputstvo
1. `W` `S` `A` `D` -> Camera movement
2. `↑` `↓` `←` `→` -> Mario/ghost movement
3. `SPACE` -> Mario jumps / ghost flies up
4. `LEFT SHIFT` -> Mushroom goes back to its box / ghost flies down
5. `C` -> Change the character
6. `1` -> Bloom on/off
7. `2` -> HDR on/off
8. `3` -> Sharpen effect on/off
9. ~~`4` -> Point shadows on/off~~

# Group A
1. Cubemaps
2. Instancing (coins)
3. Framebuffers (sharpen effect)

# Group B
1. HDR, Bloom (star in the hidden room)
2. Normal mapping (coins)
3. ~~Point shadows (in the hidden room)~~ works without HDR/bloom framebuffer?
